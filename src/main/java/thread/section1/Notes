1. Responsiveness - Concurrency
2. Performance - Parallelism

Threads shares:
    Files: All resources files
    Heap: Dynamic memory allocation (it saves values)
    Code: Code Instructions

Thread sections:
    Stack: Region where local variables are storage and function are executed
    Instruction pointer: Address to next instruction to execute

========================================================================

Context Switch is CPU process of :
    > Stop thread 1
    > Schedule thread 1 out
    > Schedule thread 2 in
    > Start Thread 2

Context Switch is no a cheap process:
    Each time a switch is perform,
    there is a process to
    > remove all data for current thread finished execution time
    > restore data for the next thread to execute

An Epoch is a time lap
CPU use Epoch to give execution time for each thread.
Not all the Threads has to complete an Epoch
